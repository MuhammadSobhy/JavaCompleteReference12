## OOP Concepts:

### 1- Abstraction: 
Human manage complexity through abstraction. for example: people do not think of a car as a tens of thousands of individual parts. They think of it as a well-defined object with its own unique behavior. This abstraction allows people to use a car to drive to the grocery store without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the individual parts. They can ignore the details of how the engine, transmission, and braking systems work. Instead, they are free to utilize the object as a whole.

### 2- Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. One way to think about encapsulation is as a protective wrapper that prevents the code and data from being arbitrarily accessed by other code defined outside the wrapper. Access to the
code and data inside the wrapper is tightly controlled through a well defined interface. In Java, the basis of encapsulation is the class. Since the purpose of a class is to encapsulate complexity, there are mechanisms for hiding the complexity of the implementation inside the class.

### 3- Inheritance:
Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object.

### 4- Polymorphism:
(one interface, multiple methods) is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.
